Annotation:
Apparently, some of you have problems with "Slic3r" in connection with Letter Cryptex! Apparently errors are displayed!
I can not help you because I do not use this program!
Allegedly, however, you can fix the error with a repair program!
Or just use another slicer (like Cura or S3D)! With Cura or S3D there are no problems, as you can already see through the many "makes"!
I am really sorry that I can not help in this special case with Slic3r! I do not have this program and I do not know it!

Description : Description: Seeing as it's almost Halloween, I thought it'd be as good time to do my take on a pumpkin... or a spider... aw heck, why not both?
For this print, I used ReelToReal's white ABS filament, and then smoothed the shell with ABS and painted it. It's great filament, at a really good price too, which is why pretty much everything I've made used their filament! I was actually originally recommended the filament by a friend who was also into 3d printing, so I'd say it's got a pretty good reputation as a brand. If you like how the print looks, you should check them out at https://reeltoreal.co.nz
